# Invasive Species
A GMTK 2023 Submission made by two friends. The theme was "roles reversed," so this game allows you to grow weeds instead of crops with the goal of taking over a field.

#### Controls: 
All actions can be done with the mouse, or you can use the following hotkeys: 1 and 2 can control the action buttons, E controls the End Turn button, and M in a game will mute the audio.

#### Known Issues: 
Clicking away after clicking an action button may waste that button's use during a turn. Farmer movement distance not well-telegraphed.
